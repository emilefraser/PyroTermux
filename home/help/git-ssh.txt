# Lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key. By default, the filenames of the public keys are one of the following:

id_ecdsa.pub
id_ed25519.pub

Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard.

If your SSH public key file has a different name than the example code, modify the filename to match your current setup. When copying your key, don't add any newlines or whitespace.
